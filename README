Simple bot writen in python 3.4 using the discord.py library to change a role's color using 2 different methods.
https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

To run: install the discord.py library, edit the role name and token, run.

Two bots are included:
Message Based
  Message Based can abuse API limits and result in an IP ban of the bot.
  This bot changes the color of a role when ever a memeber of that role sends a message. 
Timer Based 
  Cycles colors based on a random interval between 5 and 10 seconds.
  Timer Based should not be a problem with API limits.
